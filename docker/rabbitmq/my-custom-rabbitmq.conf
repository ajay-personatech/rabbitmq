# Example custom RabbitMQ configuration file
# This file will be baked into the Docker image.

# Change the default vhost RabbitMQ creates on first startup
# Note: If definitions.json is loaded and defines vhosts, those definitions take precedence.
# This is more effective if you are not using a pre-defined definitions.json that creates vhosts.
default_vhost = /customvhost

# Set a default consumer timeout (in milliseconds)
# Clients can override this, but it sets a default.
consumer_timeout = 30000

# Example: Increase the default channel_max limit
# channel_max = 4096

# Example: Configure heartbeat interval (already in ConfigMap, but showing it here for baked-in example)
# If also set in ConfigMap and ConfigMap is mounted, ConfigMap would override.
# If this is baked in, then it should NOT be in the ConfigMap if this is to be the source of truth.
# heartbeat = 60

# Ensure this file ends with a newline for POSIX compatibility.
